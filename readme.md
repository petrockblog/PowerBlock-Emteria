2. When you have installed the SDK Platform Tools, you need to set the variable `ADB_TOOL` in the file `installDriver.bat` to the correct path of your ADB installation.

3. Furtheremore, you need to set the variable `IP_OF_DEVICE`in the file `Ã¬nstallDriver.bat` to the correct IP address of your device.

4. You need to enable 'Enable ADB over Ethernet' in your Emteria installation: Open 'Settings', 'Emteria'. Activate the option 'Enable ADB over Ethernet'.


## Installation Instructions

1. If you have not done so already, make sure to do all the described steps from the Section __"Pre-Requesites"__ above.

2. Execute the batch file `installDriver.bat`.

3. Shutdown your Emteria device and connect the PowerBlock with the Raspberry Pi. Make sure to also connect the USB power to the PowerBlock.
